# REST API
GET     /v1/login                   controllers.Application.login


# JavaScript routes object
GET     /jsroutes.js                controllers.Application.jsRoutes()


# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)


# So it's possible that if not caught above then this is an angular controlled url
# that has been bookmarked by a user. To load this we need to point them at the index 
# page and give angular a chance to process it.
